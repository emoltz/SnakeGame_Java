# Snake Game -- Intro to Java Fall 2021
Snake Game made in Swing UI for NYU Intro to Java class final project

## How to Set Up
* Make sure the database driver for sqlite is connected (.jar file included)
* **If running it in Eclipse** you have to import it as a project first so the dependencies are there. The database should be connected after that. 

## How It's Changed Since the Proposal
* Originally, I wanted to include obstacles, but I thought it would make the game way too difficult. 
* I also wanted to have a 'window' menu so they could re-size the game window, but this required a complete re-writing of the game's architecture and didn't seem worth it.

## Instructions/Features
* Run Main.java
* Play Game
* File-> Save to save your score
* File -> New game to start a new game
